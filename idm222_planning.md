#### Content Preparation/Planning 
_________________________________
1. Home Page
    - Include more of a why/purpose of website below the fold for desktop and tablet view 
    - Change picture or improve current picture quality because it looks fine on mobile but a bit blurry on desktop
2. About Me Page
    - No changes 
3. Professional Page
    - Create dropdown for projects
    - Need to review if project slides can be added to website or not based on confidentiality, but if not will create extensive summary documents to include 
4. Connect Page
    - Working form?
5. Overall Style
    - Sticking with black and white color scheme
    - Keeping Gill Sans font
    - Might format picture and content side to side for more effective scroll on desktop and tablet instead of top to bottom
